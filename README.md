# flask-sqlite-demo
Demo web server with SQLite database management.

This app uses the Flask module to create a simple website which allows viewing and editing a database containing information about people, such as their name, age, email and address.
The database is a simple serverless SQLite database. Entries can be modified, added and removed. For more info check the `web/doc.html` page.

To run the app, just run `python3 app.py`.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please keep in mind that this application is just a demo. It was not built with security/stability in mind! Please don't take this code and use it on some production server üôÇ
